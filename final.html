        <h1> CSC 106 Final Project  </h1>
            <p> This is my final project for CSC 106. For my project my partner and I chose to do a re-creation of the game flappy bird.
              We renamed it flappy bit. The goal of this game is to navigate your way through the pipes without touching them for as long as you can. 
             The longer you go the higher your score will be. This program consists of 3 scenes, splash screen, the actual game, and a game over screen. 
              This was a game that when I was growing up I greatly enjoyed playing and now I'm happy that I get to share my joy through my code. </p>
